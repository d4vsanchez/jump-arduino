# Jump

This is a very simple game for Arduino, you should avoid having the ball deflated by falling into the spikes.

## Getting started

To run this project you must have the following items:

- [Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed in your computer.
- An [Arduino UNO compatible board](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3).
- A push button.
- An LCD screen.
- A 12KΩ resistor.
- A 220Ω resistor.
- Jumper wires.

## Installation

1. Clone the project.
2. Open `jump.ino` with Arduino IDE.
3. Upload it to your Arduino UNO.

## How does this work?

[I made a tweet about this](https://twitter.com/d4vsanchez/status/1312879111346544641).


## To Do list

The following items are missing to say this is v1 release:

[] I may have a bug somewhere because the LCD flickers strangely in the "Game Over" message.
[] A better animation when the ball jumps.
[] A blog entry explaining how I did it.
[] Better screenshots to show what does this do.
[] Cleaning up code.
